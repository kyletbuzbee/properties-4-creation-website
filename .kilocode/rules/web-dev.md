# Modern Web Standards
- ACCESSIBILITY: Every interactive element must have appropriate ARIA labels. Images must have `alt` tags.
- RESPONSIVENESS: Use Tailwind CSS or CSS Grid/Flexbox for all layouts. Ensure mobile-first design.
- PERFORMANCE: Prefer native browser APIs over heavy external libraries unless specifically requested.
