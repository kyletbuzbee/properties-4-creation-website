          <div class="story-text">
            <p>Properties 4 Creations was founded by veterans who experienced firsthand the housing challenges that many military families and veterans face. After serving our country, we returned home only to encounter inadequate housing options that didn't meet our needs or reflect the quality of life we deserved.</p>
            <p>We saw the same struggles in our communities - families working multiple jobs just to afford basic housing, veterans living in substandard conditions, and communities suffering from housing instability. We knew there had to be a better way.</p>
            <p>That's why we started Properties 4 Creations. As a veteran-owned and operated company, we bring personal understanding and professional expertise to every property we renovate and every family we serve. We're not just in the business of housing - we're in the business of building stronger communities.</p>
